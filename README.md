# Camera-Movements
Detecting camera movements using Vision.


## Movements

### Move-in and Move-out Movements (done with dollying)
The shots, in which camera zoom-in slowly, are to make the viewer focus on something. An intense expression or a thoughtful expression can be shown with a zooming in movement and slowly make a closeup shot. 

Similarly, zoom-out movement can be used to elaborate a view, to show something necessary around the earlier point of focus.

Such shots are filmed with the camera on a stable place, like a dolly, which would be carried to create a sense of zoom in or zoom out.


### Panning and Tilting
Panning is the movement of the camera on a horizontal axis. This type of movement helps us to frame a moving point of the object or to frame a long horizontal scene. Also, this type of shots is filmed with 'truck' movements, which have a camera that can move horizontally with different speed, that carries a shot from the point of the movement.

Tilting is the movement of the camera on a vertical axis, used for various general purposes.


### Sled and Vest
In such camera movements, the camera is attached with the body of the director and can be moved with the motion of person himself. Such type of scenes are hard to film and are most often filmed with a single shot, this means no abrupt cutting.


## Approach

I will try to generalize according to the graphs, that will be plotted --changing pixels in a shot vs. shot length-- which itself can be plotted with a variety of time periods.

For e.g. in a zoom-in out, with dolly movement, the outermost path of the frame in the camera will most likely to change abruptly (with its digitized colored pixels) rather than the center part, on which the main focus of the camera is. Such type of generalization can be fully appreciated after results and graphs; which we will be done after the implementation.
