# Camera-Movements
Detecting camera movements using Vision.


## Move-in and Move-out Movements (done with dollying)
The shots, in which camera zoom-in slowly, are to make viewer focus on something. An intense expression, or a thoughtful expression can be shown with a zooming in movement and slowly making a closeup shot. 

Similarly, zoom-out movement can be used to elaborate a view, to show something necessary around the earlier point of focus.

Such shots are filmed with camera on a stable place, like a dolly, which would be carried to create a sense of zoom in or zoom out.


## Panning and Tilting
Panning is the movement of camera on a horizontal axis. This type of movement helps us to frame a moving point of object, or to frame a long horizontal scene. Also, this type of shots are filmed with 'truck' movements, which have a camera that can move horizontal with different speed, that carry a shot the point of movement.

Tilting is the movement of camera on a vertical axis, used for various general purposes.


## Sled and Vest
In such camera movements, the camera is attached with the body of the director, and can be moved with the motion of person himself. Such type of scenes are hard to film and are most often filmed with a single shot, this means no abrupt cuttting.
